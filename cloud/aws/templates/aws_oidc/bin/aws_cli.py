        Returns the ID and rolloutState of the PRIMARY ECS service deployment. If
        the CiviForm service is not found or there is no PRIMARY deployment
        found, an empty dictionary is returned.

        An ECS service has many deployments. Each deployment has a status of
        PRIMARY, ACTIVE, or INACTIVE. There can only be one deployment with the
        PRIMARY status.

        Each deployment has a rolloutState of COMPLETED, FAILED, or IN_PROGRESS.
        The deployment becomes COMPLETED when all its containers pass their
        healthchecks.

        For CiviForm, the service usually only has one deployment. When we
        upgrade the CiviForm server version, the deployment for the old version
        goes to ACTIVE and a new PRIMARY deployment is created for the new
        version. Once the new PRIMARY deployment has a rolloutState of
        COMPLETED, the ACTIVE deployment stops its tasks and goes to the
        INACTIVE state.

        Because we have the deployment circuit breaker enabled, if a deployment
        fails, it will roll back to the last successful deployment and mark it
        as PRIMARY again. This is why we also provide the ID in this function, so
        that we can detect if the new deployment was successful, or if we've
        rolled back.
