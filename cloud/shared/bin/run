# Script for running the commands supported by the deploy system by calling run.py.
# See comments below for why we need this script rather than running run.py directly.
# TODO(#4612) Enable the env-var-docs variable generation feature by using this script
# instead of run.py across the civiform-deploy repository

# In the server code repository in git(civiform), we define a python package called env-var-docs.
# https://github.com/civiform/civiform/tree/main/env-var-docs
# Its purpose is to automate various aspects of adding a variable to application.conf.
# Variables in application.conf make the server configurable.
# To make the variables configurable via the deploy system, we need the env-var-docs package.
# To get access to the package, we create a python virtual environment(venv), install the package and
# activate the venv. The activation has to happen in the parent process before the python code is run.
# This is why we need a bash script that preceeds the python code
source cloud/shared/bin/python_env_setup
# TODO(#4612)Download the newest version of the package rather than a fixed version.
