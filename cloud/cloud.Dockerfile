# The eclipse-temurin image and the standard openJDK11 fails to run on M1 Macs because it is incompatible with ARM architecture. This
# workaround uses an aarch64 (arm64) image instead when an optional platform argument is set to arm64.
# Docker's BuildKit skips unused stages so the image for the platform that isn't used will not be built.
